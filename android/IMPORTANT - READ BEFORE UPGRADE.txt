--------------- ATTENTION ---------------------

Unfortunately I suffered a hard disk defect recently.
Thus the binaries signing keys have changed. 

If you install the lastest 0.7.5 release, all your
previous databases will be ERASED due to the changed
signing key.

To keep your tracking database, save it manually before
upgrade by using

adb pull data/data/org.openbmap/databases/radiobeacon

After the upgrade you can manually restore them by

adb push radiobeacon

data/data/org.openbmap/databases/radiobeacon
